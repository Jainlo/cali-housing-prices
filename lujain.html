<p>The most commonly configured hyperparameters are the following: - n_estimators: The number of trees, often increased until no further improvements are seen. - max_depth: The maximum depth of each tree, often values are between 1 and 10. - eta: The learning rate used to weight each model, often set to small values such as 0.3, 0.1, 0.01, or smaller. - subsample: The number of samples (rows) used in each tree, set to a value between 0 and 1, often 1.0 to use all samples. - colsample_bytree: Number of features (columns) used in each tree, set to a value between 0 and 1, often 1.0 to use all features.</p>
<p>To find the best hyperparameter combination, we perform random search.</p>
